GUARDIAN RESPONSE TO EVALUATE:
"{guardian_response}"

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Did the guardian agree, commit, or imply they would give the player a phone?

Consider "YES" if the response:
- Explicitly agrees to give/provide a phone ("Okay, you can have a phone")
- Says player wins or can take a phone
- Confirms giving the phone
- Uses phrases like "I'll give you", "you got me", "take a phone", "you win"

Consider "NO" if the response:
- Only expresses wishes ("I wish I could")
- Challenges player to try again
- Declines the request
- Talks about phones without agreeing

Be lenient but fair. Focus on whether the guardian AGREED, not just mentioned phones.
